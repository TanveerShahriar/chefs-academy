This space was created so that you can get a sense of me as a person and as a web developer. Here you will find examples of my work and an explanation of the logic behind different choices I've made while working on them. My main focus is front-end development, but I'm getting into back-end development too. That's why I took this course and completing the journey sincerely. After that I would love to learn more advance topics and also a intern as a junior web developer.</p>
